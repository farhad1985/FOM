Fom is a time management application based on the Pomodoro technique. You can focus on your work for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. It is free and open-source, and youâ€™re welcome to modify it as long as you give me credit.

## Support
Using this app is free but if you enjoy using it, you can support me :)
